# T-SHIRT: Token-Selective Hierarchical Data Selection for Instruction Tuning

Thank you for your interest in our work!

We are currently preparing the full codebase for public release. The complete implementation will be open-sourced **by late November**, prior to the conference.

In the meantime, you can find a version of the code and other details in the **supplementary materials** on our [OpenReview submission](https://openreview.net/forum?id=oN5YVZ9JeF).

Stay tuned, and thank you for your patience!
